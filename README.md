# Excel Kickstarter Analysis

##Overview
Louise is in charge of many fundraising projects in several different industries, but is unable to determine why some projects succeed and others fail.  

###Purpose
Louise wanted a detailed analysis of her sizeable kickstarter fundraising projects, so we were hired to determine why projects succeeded or failed. Based on industry "parent categories" and subcategories, as well as the country the fundraiser was occurring, we compared projects based on their launch dates and fundraising goals.

##Analysis and Challenges
To begin, we looked at successful and failed campaigns within the US. We created descriptive statistics for the fundraising goals vs what was pledged, including mean, median, standard deviation, and interquartile range.
